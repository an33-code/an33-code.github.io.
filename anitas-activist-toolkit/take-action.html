    <h2>What is Food Insecurity?</h2>
    <p>Lack of continuous access to adequate food for every member of a household to live an active, healthy life is known as food insecurity. A household may be in this predicament for a short while or for a very long period. One indicator of how many people cannot afford food is food insecurity. Food insecurity is more likely to affect those with poor educational levels, frail social networks, little social capital, low household incomes, and single mothers.</p>

    <h2>What can YOU do?</h2>
    <p>The fact that the fundamental causes of food insecurity—poverty, unemployment/underemployment, and uneven access to adequate healthful food—are frequently intricately intertwined makes it difficult to address in part. Nevertheless, some solutions can be is donating to food charities such as FeedingAmerica and ActionAgainstHunger. Some long-term solutions include supporting local urban farms that contribute to greater food security by offering low-income populations low-cost, fresh vegetables. Urban agriculture increases food security by offering affordable and wholesome alternatives to food that must be purchased, particularly for low-income households. Urban farmers are also more likely to have access to a greater range of healthy meals, such as vegetables and animal products, for their families. Ending food insecurity can be aided by reducing personal and societal waste.Food that is being wasted but is otherwise healthy may feed hungry families. Food that is presently thrown out yet is safe and healthy might help feed the hungry and lessen food insecurity.
